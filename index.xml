&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://insecam.org">Insecam&lt;/a> is a website which crawls the insecure network cameras connected to the Internet without any authentication throughout the world.
According to the &lt;a href="http://insecam.org/en/faq/">website&amp;rsquo;s FAQ&lt;/a>, they are collecting the network cameras without password protection and listing the live video feed of them.
They also claims that the cameras are not hacked, but the vulnerable software may enable the remote access without any authentication.
The website provides a grouped view by camera manufacturers, installed countries and cities, places.
Unless the network camera is supposed to broadcast a public video stream, the owner of the network camera is supposed to apply at least a proper password authentication to protect their video stream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The installation and usage of video surveillance devices are regulated by Personal Information Protection Act&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, Article 25.
According to the law, the owner of the video surveilance device must secure their device in order to protect the personal information.
In addition, the device must not record any voice and record places outside of its intended purpose.
Regardless of the legal code, the number of video surveilance devices installed by public institutions are in constant rise&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and about 1.3 million devices are installed as of 2020.
There is no accurate number of video surveilance devices installed by private person, but one report estimates the number as 13 million devices in 2017&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
In addition, about 89 percent of Korean cars have dashcams installed in 2019&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least the legal code seems to be good, but how come the picture below became the reality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/insecam_korea.png" alt="South Korea is in 2nd place of Insecam">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of the time of the writing, South Korea is ranked 2nd in the &lt;a href="http://insecam.org">Insecam&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s country list.
To make things even more ironical, Insecam website is blocked in Korea by Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC).
The block was decided around early 2016&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, to &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo; the privacy of Korean people.
This block is not effective against those who outside of Korea, and as everyone knows, cybercriminals these days do not know the national border.
The root cause of this problem &amp;ndash; unprotected network camera &amp;ndash; remains unsolved, as Korean police decided that there is no way to inform the individuals on the problem of their network camera&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
To make things more worse, rebadged cheap camera by Korean companies often do not get adequate support from the original manufacturer, leaving the users vulnerable.
This was demonstrated in Petzview incident around 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-petzview-incident">The Petzview Incident&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There was a network camera named Petzview, which was marketed towards companion animal owners to monitor their loved ones from outside of their home.
The device was sold for several years, and was used by not only individual peoples but also by veterinary clinics too.
The hardware itself was not that special as seen in the image below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/petzview.jpg" alt="Petzview hardware">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In October 2018, Petzview announced that they will shut down their web service&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> to share the live footage of Petzview devices&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and discontinue the mobile app to control the network camera.
According to the news report, an owner of Petzview network camera found that their camera had been compromised in &lt;strong>2012&lt;/strong>, and found the security vulnerability in &lt;strong>2014&lt;/strong>, which he exploited to illegally record the other Petzview users for at least 4 years.
The attack was only discovered in 2018, and the hacker was arrested for privacy invasions by illegal recording.
Well, if you look into the source code of the web archive, you may find interesting thing there which tells about the security mindset of the Petzview designers :(&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as these kind of insecure network cameras are connected to the Internet without software updates, and Korean authorities are burying their head in the sand like just blocking the Insecam website instead of regulating the market tightly, we don&amp;rsquo;t believe that the number of network cameras listed in the Insecam will decrease.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a result, the benefit of a shared vulnerability database does not exist in KVE. Security researchers waste time writing reports about duplicated vulnerabilities because they do not have access to the database. End-users and system administrators are unable to know what threat they are currently exposed because the information is kept secret.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their existence is only known to researchers through the KISA bug bounty program, which replies to the researcher&amp;rsquo;s mail with their useless database reference ID.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>K Security Programs</title><link>https://pages.nowhere.rc3.silicon.moe/posts/k-security-programs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 04:12:39 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nowhere.rc3.silicon.moe/posts/k-security-programs/</guid><description/><content/></item><item><title>K Builtin Iot</title><link>https://pages.nowhere.rc3.silicon.moe/posts/k-builtin-iot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 02:37:01 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nowhere.rc3.silicon.moe/posts/k-builtin-iot/</guid><description>Security of Korean built-in home automation system In South Korea, lots of new apartments are high-grade IT infrastructure certified.

&lt;p>The concept of &lt;a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/routers/routers.en.html">router freedom&lt;/a> in South Korea is&amp;hellip; well, not actively discussed in this moment.
The following figure is copied from BEREC report explaining the network termination point.
While using self-bought modem is &amp;ldquo;technically&amp;rdquo; possible, but this happens very seldom in reality and the modem is supplied by the ISP at a lower rate or even for free, regardless of the type of last mile (e.g. DOCSIS, FTTx, ethernet).
Most of the modems supplied by the ISP does not have an integrated router function, therefore either ISP-supplied router or a self-bought router could be used.
But wait a second&amp;hellip; Ethernet as a last mile?
Most South Koreans lives in an apartment, and some apartment provide an ethernet connection directly to the each households, effectively eliminating any kind of modem and the router is freely choiceable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/ntp.png" alt="Illustration of network termination points">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most popular WRT in private households is &lt;a href="https://iptime.com/iptime/">ipTIME&lt;/a>, followed by other Korean vendors such as WeVO.
There used be much more smaller Korean vendors selling home WRT, but they got consolidated in the market throughout the last decade.
Other global vendors such as Asus, Belkin, D-Link are usually bought by power users who is not satisfied by performance or software of what ipTIME or other Korean vendors provide, and have limited market presence.
This makes the situation hard in several aspects: local brand WRTs got OpenWrt support only in recent days, while the &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rdquo; firmware of those WRTs have security holes and patched them in very clever way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iptime-and-gpl-openwrt">ipTIME and GPL, OpenWrt&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ipTIME in year 2007 claimed that &amp;ldquo;it is not fair that the GPL enforcement is harsh on small-sized enterprises&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, however, they slowly changed their mind and opened up some of their GPLed source codes around 2017.
In addition to this, they used Realtek &amp;ndash; infamous for their non-support status in OpenWrt &amp;ndash; in the past and changed their chipsets to other than Realtek during mid-2010s.
As a result (and lack of general interest), not many devices of ipTIME is listed as supported device of OpenWrt&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
One exceptional case is FREEZIO&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, where the company opened up the source code which is based on the OpenWrt.
But as far as we know, not many vendors seems to comply with the terms of GPL.
There are some other Korean WRTs listed in the hardware list of OpenWrt, but these are mostly reverse engineered from the ground and adapted the source code from other routers sharing the same SoCs, as vendors are not usually opening up their code either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small number of Korean hackers are doing, and most of them are also hanging out in the Jitsi here, so feel free to ask them about the experience :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-home-router-insecurity">The Home Router (In)security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We found the input sanitization bug leading to the remote code execution on one of the Korean WRT.
Unfortunately, quite a lot of text field&amp;rsquo;s inputs in the configuration page are piped into the shell scripts of Korean WRTs, and not many vendors take care about proper sanitzation or implement without using shell script.
We have reported the problem to the vendor and KISA (Korea Internet Security Agency) bug bounty program about this problem.
Several vendors have responded in various 🤦 ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the vendor just removed the problematic text input field in their next firmware release, citing the feature as auxilary diagnostic function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the vendor have &amp;ldquo;implemented&amp;rdquo; some input text field sanitization method, which looks for known keywords using &lt;code>strchr&lt;/code> and &lt;code>strstr&lt;/code> function.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how they implemented this function (and prepare some popcorn for the function&amp;rsquo;s name):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>bool check_hacking(char *cmd, int len) {
/* snip */
ret = strchr(cmd, ';');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '|');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '&amp;amp;');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '\');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '`');
if (ret != 0) return true;
/* snip */
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;wget&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;echo&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;/bin/&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;sh&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
/* snip */
ret = strchr(cmd, '[');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '&amp;gt;');
if (ret != 0) return true;
return false;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To make things more worse, even we have found the bug in the &amp;ldquo;sanitization&amp;rdquo; method after they had fixed the original problem, the vendor claimed that the product is EOL and no updates will be provided.
We believe that the EOL is just a made-up cause, as the product in question is actively sold in the market when we got the vendor&amp;rsquo;s EOL claim.
What should we do?
We have no idea.&lt;/p>
