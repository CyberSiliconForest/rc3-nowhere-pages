# KVE?
There was a CVE, short of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, a public database of disclosed computer security flaws. It benefits many system administrators and security researchers by sharing the known vulnerability and helping them to fix those holes.

And, Korean government thought, they want to have one, but they thought sharing that information publically will cause many troubles. So, they built the vulnerability database called KVE but keep its content secret, even its abstract information such as severity, impact, type of vulnerability.

As a result, the benefit of a shared vulnerability database does not exist in KVE. Security researchers waste time writing reports about duplicated vulnerabilities because they do not have access to the database. End-users and system administrators are unable to know what threat they are currently exposed because the information is kept secret.

Their existence is only known to researchers through the KISA bug bounty program, which replies to the researcher's mail with their useless database reference ID.
