# About SiliconForest

We are a group of hackers located in South Korea, mostly interested in information security and hardware hacking.

# What do we present on this event

We want to present "K-Security": how Korean companies are building the security theater and what is behind the scenes. We have hacked home routers, IoT devices, websites, etc. and recognized by several bug bounty programs.
