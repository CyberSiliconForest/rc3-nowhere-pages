# Introduction

Welcome to the exposition room of the SiliconForest assembly. 
We display here various topics related to the security of (mostly) embedded devices and everyday life in South Korea.
There might be some incomplete pages or missing themes, but we hope that you can enjoy our contents based on the real stories and experiences.
Thank you!
