&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://insecam.org">Insecam&lt;/a> is a website which crawls the insecure network cameras connected to the Internet without any authentication throughout the world.
According to the &lt;a href="http://insecam.org/en/faq/">website&amp;rsquo;s FAQ&lt;/a>, they are collecting the network cameras without password protection and listing the live video feed of them.
They also claims that the cameras are not hacked, but the vulnerable software may enable the remote access without any authentication.
The website provides a grouped view by camera manufacturers, installed countries and cities, places.
Unless the network camera is supposed to broadcast a public video stream, the owner of the network camera is supposed to apply at least a proper password authentication to protect their video stream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The installation and usage of video surveillance devices are regulated by Personal Information Protection Act&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, Article 25.
According to the law, the owner of the video surveilance device must secure their device in order to protect the personal information.
In addition, the device must not record any voice and record places outside of its intended purpose.
Regardless of the legal code, the number of video surveilance devices installed by public institutions are in constant rise&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and about 1.3 million devices are installed as of 2020.
There is no accurate number of video surveilance devices installed by private person, but one report estimates the number as 13 million devices in 2017&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
In addition, about 89 percent of Korean cars have dashcams installed in 2019&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least the legal code seems to be good, but how come the picture below became the reality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/insecam_korea.png" alt="South Korea is in 2nd place of Insecam">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of the time of the writing, South Korea is ranked 2nd in the &lt;a href="http://insecam.org">Insecam&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s country list.
To make things even more ironical, Insecam website is blocked in Korea by Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC).
The block was decided around early 2016&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, to &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo; the privacy of Korean people.
This block is not effective against those who outside of Korea, and as everyone knows, cybercriminals these days do not know the national border.
The root cause of this problem &amp;ndash; unprotected network camera &amp;ndash; remains unsolved, as Korean police decided that there is no way to inform the individuals on the problem of their network camera&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
To make things more worse, rebadged cheap camera by Korean companies often do not get adequate support from the original manufacturer, leaving the users vulnerable.
This was demonstrated in Petzview incident around 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-petzview-incident">The Petzview Incident&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There was a network camera named Petzview, which was marketed towards companion animal owners to monitor their loved ones from outside of their home.
The device was sold for several years, and was used by not only individual peoples but also by veterinary clinics too.
The hardware itself was not that special as seen in the image below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/petzview.jpg" alt="Petzview hardware">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In October 2018, Petzview announced that they will shut down their web service&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> to share the live footage of Petzview devices&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and discontinue the mobile app to control the network camera.
According to the news report, an owner of Petzview network camera found that their camera had been compromised in &lt;strong>2012&lt;/strong>, and found the security vulnerability in &lt;strong>2014&lt;/strong>, which he exploited to illegally record the other Petzview users for at least 4 years.
The attack was only discovered in 2018, and the hacker was arrested for privacy invasions by illegal recording.
Well, if you look into the source code of the web archive, you may find interesting thing there which tells about the security mindset of the Petzview designers :(&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as these kind of insecure network cameras are connected to the Internet without software updates, and Korean authorities are burying their head in the sand like just blocking the Insecam website instead of regulating the market tightly, we don&amp;rsquo;t believe that the number of network cameras listed in the Insecam will decrease.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>South Korea is always actively insisting on the &amp;ldquo;platform sovereignty&amp;rdquo;.
After a boom caused by Squid Game on Netflix, some Koreans thought that Netflix is not giving a fair share to Korean studios&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and complained why there is no local equivalent of Netflix which can attract users like what Squid Game did.
Even an ISP sued Netflix&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> citing that they are not paying enough for the traffic caused by Netflix services.
Well, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to discuss on the Squid Game or why some of Google and Apple services are not available in Korea in this article, but that kind of mentality is prevalent in various places of Korean society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a security researcher, everyone should know &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)&lt;/a>.
MITRE Corporation maintains a nice public database of disclosed computer security flaws.
It benefits many system administrators and security researchers by sharing the known vulnerability and helping them to fix those holes.
Also, the software vendors also include CVE numbers for their security patches in order to announce what security problem they fixed.
The CVE is used globally and the vulnerability database also contains region-specific products and their vulnerabilities too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then here comes the &amp;ldquo;platform sovereignty&amp;rdquo; mind of Korean institution.
Having a local equivalent of CVE could be beneficial for overcoming language barrier, since CVE is only available in English.
Small-sized companies may cite the language problem as the reason of not-observing best practice and fixing their security vulnerabilities, which could be mitigated by publicly funded institution giving some CVE translation&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
Now meet KVE, which is designed &amp;ldquo;local equivalent&amp;rdquo; of CVE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do not deny that a localized vulnerability device can help the local software vendors and users.
However, the biggest difference between CVE and KVE is that the latter database is only available internally within KrCERT.
If you search with the keyword such as &amp;ldquo;KVE vulnerability&amp;rdquo;, what you will get is mostly the notice in Korean and a line in changelog mentioning that the vulnerability had been fixed.
Hmm, now what? Why there is no information of the vulnerability itself publicly available at all, even its abstract information such as severity, impact, type of vulnerability?
Is it to covering the mistakes made by local (small) companies and not to ruin their reputation?
We really don&amp;rsquo;t know and want to know why we can&amp;rsquo;t see the whole database, not the fragment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following examples are how the KVE ID is used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An IP camera company &amp;ldquo;disabled&amp;rdquo; ONVIF access due to the missing access control on ONVIF interface allowing anyone to see the stream&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Note that &amp;ldquo;disable the feature because we can&amp;rsquo;t secure that&amp;rdquo; mindset is quite prevalent among small Korean companies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An archiver software patched NSIS and TAR file handling, citing the KVE ID&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. No one knows what is the exact problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A web CMS software patched a security hole citing the KVE ID&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Details could only be guessed from the patch.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a security researcher, we find that the non-public vulnerability database targetting the public produces make little or no sense at all.
Security researchers waste time writing reports about duplicated vulnerabilities because they do not have access to the database.
End-users and system administrators are unable to know what threat they are currently exposed because the information is kept secret, and have to rely on the mercy of software vendors.
The KVE ID&amp;rsquo;s existence is only known to researchers through the KISA bug bounty program, which replies to the researcher&amp;rsquo;s mail with their useless database reference ID.
We believe that opening up the KVE database will bring more positive effect in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apartments are the most wanted form of housing in South Korea, and the prices of apartments are one of the delicate theme of politics too.
One of the important factor affecting the apartment pricing is available network infrastructure and availability of home automation system.
Even there is a certification on the high-speed telecommunication&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> in the aparements, which mandates optical fibre and/or ethernet link to the house and inside the house.
If an apartment does not have an infrastructure for even medium-speed Internet, this actually negatively affects the price of the property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make things more interesting, there is even home network certification&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> which defines the minimal required home networking facilities in the apartment.
To get the certification, at least these type of installation is required:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Direct fibre-optic connection to the home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Home automation system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Built-in Wi-Fi access point&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and more things that are not so much important in this context&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Because this is considered as a premium in housing market, newer apartments (especially built after 2010s) applies for this certification.
There is a security requirement in the Class AAA Home IoT certification&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, which sounds okay in the first glance.
The security requirement itself is reasonable enough, and there are some &amp;ldquo;certified&amp;rdquo; devices in the market&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
Sounds good up to this moment, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hacked-wallpads-on-raidforums">Hacked Wallpads on Raidforums&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On 15th October 2021, a Raidforums user opened a thread claiming that they are selling the video footage from hacked home automation systems in Korea&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
This also became sensational in Korean news reports.
The person also posted a list of hacked apartments (original images deleted in RF), spanning around the whole nation.
The video footage contains internals of private houses, and could even contain explicit images and videos too.
Because most of affected people are not tech-savvy, and it is usually not possible to replace the home automation system by the home owners themselves, only a mitigation such as covering the camera is proposed as a solution.
The ultimate solution is proper security of the home automation system, though not all affected vendors are able and willing to do that (especially for older discontinued models).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How this things could happen even though there is &amp;ldquo;certification&amp;rdquo;?
In reality, the devices get very poor maintenance after its initial installation and small-sized vendors also discontinue their home automation products quickly.
The lifetime of home automation devices are shorter than the lifetime of the building in reality, and older discontinued devices eventually ends up in a dead end without any security patches and updates.
They also charge quite a lot of amount to home owners especially for discontinued devices&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have investigated some of home automation systems in Korea, and found interesting bugs and vulnerabilities here and there.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bugs-and-problems-of-home-automation-system">Bugs and Problems of Home Automation System&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="blinkenlights">Blinkenlights!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The built-in home automation system fully trusts the internal network. The control server sends the command without any authentication or encryption and, the home automation controller accepts the connection if it has a &amp;ldquo;valid&amp;rdquo; IP address. They do not care it is spoofed or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, every room can send a spoofed packet to control someone else&amp;rsquo;s home automation system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="no-one-is-listening-to-the-ism-band-right">No one is listening to the ISM band. Right?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Lots of Korean built-in home automation system has integrated RF transmitter which opens the entrance door. So it must be designed with security in mind. Right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, lots of them just send RF signals without any anti-replay mechanism and can be replayed without much effort. Grab the SDR and replay the signal. Door unlocks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The concept of &lt;a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/routers/routers.en.html">router freedom&lt;/a> in South Korea is&amp;hellip; well, not actively discussed in this moment.
The following figure is copied from BEREC report explaining the network termination point.
While using self-bought modem is &amp;ldquo;technically&amp;rdquo; possible, but this happens very seldom in reality and the modem is supplied by the ISP at a lower rate or even for free, regardless of the type of last mile (e.g. DOCSIS, FTTx, ethernet).
Most of the modems supplied by the ISP does not have an integrated router function, therefore either ISP-supplied router or a self-bought router could be used.
But wait a second&amp;hellip; Ethernet as a last mile?
Most South Koreans lives in an apartment, and some apartment provide an ethernet connection directly to the each households, effectively eliminating any kind of modem and the router is freely choiceable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/ntp.png" alt="Illustration of network termination points">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most popular WRT in private households is &lt;a href="https://iptime.com/iptime/">ipTIME&lt;/a>, followed by other Korean vendors such as WeVO.
There used be much more smaller Korean vendors selling home WRT, but they got consolidated in the market throughout the last decade.
Other global vendors such as Asus, Belkin, D-Link are usually bought by power users who is not satisfied by performance or software of what ipTIME or other Korean vendors provide, and have limited market presence.
This makes the situation hard in several aspects: local brand WRTs got OpenWrt support only in recent days, while the &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rdquo; firmware of those WRTs have security holes and patched them in very clever way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iptime-and-gpl-openwrt">ipTIME and GPL, OpenWrt&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ipTIME in year 2007 claimed that &amp;ldquo;it is not fair that the GPL enforcement is harsh on small-sized enterprises&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, however, they slowly changed their mind and opened up some of their GPLed source codes around 2017.
In addition to this, they used Realtek &amp;ndash; infamous for their non-support status in OpenWrt &amp;ndash; in the past and changed their chipsets to other than Realtek during mid-2010s.
As a result (and lack of general interest), not many devices of ipTIME is listed as supported device of OpenWrt&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
One exceptional case is FREEZIO&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, where the company opened up the source code which is based on the OpenWrt.
But as far as we know, not many vendors seems to comply with the terms of GPL.
There are some other Korean WRTs listed in the hardware list of OpenWrt, but these are mostly reverse engineered from the ground and adapted the source code from other routers sharing the same SoCs, as vendors are not usually opening up their code either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small number of Korean hackers are doing, and most of them are also hanging out in the Jitsi here, so feel free to ask them about the experience :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-home-router-insecurity">The Home Router (In)security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We found the input sanitization bug leading to the remote code execution on one of the Korean WRT.
Unfortunately, quite a lot of text field&amp;rsquo;s inputs in the configuration page are piped into the shell scripts of Korean WRTs, and not many vendors take care about proper sanitzation or implement without using shell script.
We have reported the problem to the vendor and KISA (Korea Internet Security Agency) bug bounty program about this problem.
Several vendors have responded in various 🤦 ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the vendor just removed the problematic text input field in their next firmware release, citing the feature as auxilary diagnostic function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the vendor have &amp;ldquo;implemented&amp;rdquo; some input text field sanitization method, which looks for known keywords using &lt;code>strchr&lt;/code> and &lt;code>strstr&lt;/code> function.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how they implemented this function (and prepare some popcorn for the function&amp;rsquo;s name):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>bool check_hacking(char *cmd, int len) {
/* snip */
ret = strchr(cmd, ';');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '|');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '&amp;amp;');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '\');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '`');
if (ret != 0) return true;
/* snip */
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;wget&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;echo&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;/bin/&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strstr(cmd, &amp;quot;sh&amp;quot;);
if (ret != 0) return true;
/* snip */
ret = strchr(cmd, '[');
if (ret != 0) return true;
ret = strchr(cmd, '&amp;gt;');
if (ret != 0) return true;
return false;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To make things more worse, even we have found the bug in the &amp;ldquo;sanitization&amp;rdquo; method after they had fixed the original problem, the vendor claimed that the product is EOL and no updates will be provided.
We believe that the EOL is just a made-up cause, as the product in question is actively sold in the market when we got the vendor&amp;rsquo;s EOL claim.
What should we do?
We have no idea.&lt;/p>
