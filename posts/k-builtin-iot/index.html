<p>Apartments are the most wanted form of housing in South Korea, and the prices of apartments are one of the delicate theme of politics too.
One of the important factor affecting the apartment pricing is available network infrastructure and availability of home automation system.
Even there is a certification on the high-speed telecommunication<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> in the aparements, which mandates optical fibre and/or ethernet link to the house and inside the house.
If an apartment does not have an infrastructure for even medium-speed Internet, this actually negatively affects the price of the property.</p>
<p>To make things more interesting, there is even home network certification<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> which defines the minimal required home networking facilities in the apartment.
To get the certification, at least these type of installation is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct fibre-optic connection to the home</li>
<li>Home automation system</li>
<li>Built-in Wi-Fi access point</li>
<li>and more things that are not so much important in this context</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this is considered as a premium in housing market, newer apartments (especially built after 2010s) applies for this certification.
There is a security requirement in the Class AAA Home IoT certification<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, which sounds okay in the first glance.
The security requirement itself is reasonable enough, and there are some &ldquo;certified&rdquo; devices in the market<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>.
Sounds good up to this moment, but&mldr;</p>
<h2 id=hacked-wallpads-on-raidforums>Hacked Wallpads on Raidforums<a href=#hacked-wallpads-on-raidforums class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>On 15th October 2021, a Raidforums user opened a thread claiming that they are selling the video footage from hacked home automation systems in Korea<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>.
This also became sensational in Korean news reports.
The person also posted a list of hacked apartments (original images deleted in RF), spanning around the whole nation.
The video footage contains internals of private houses, and could even contain explicit images and videos too.
Because most of affected people are not tech-savvy, and it is usually not possible to replace the home automation system by the home owners themselves, only a mitigation such as covering the camera is proposed as a solution.
The ultimate solution is proper security of the home automation system, though not all affected vendors are able and willing to do that (especially for older discontinued models).</p>
<p>How this things could happen even though there is &ldquo;certification&rdquo;?
In reality, the devices get very poor maintenance after its initial installation and small-sized vendors also discontinue their home automation products quickly.
The lifetime of home automation devices are shorter than the lifetime of the building in reality, and older discontinued devices eventually ends up in a dead end without any security patches and updates.
They also charge quite a lot of amount to home owners especially for discontinued devices<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We have investigated some of home automation systems in Korea, and found interesting bugs and vulnerabilities here and there.</p>

<h3 id=blinkenlights>Blinkenlights!<a href=#blinkenlights class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The built-in home automation system fully trusts the internal network. The control server sends the command without any authentication or encryption and, the home automation controller accepts the connection if it has a &ldquo;valid&rdquo; IP address. They do not care it is spoofed or not.</p>
<p>As a result, every room can send a spoofed packet to control someone else&rsquo;s home automation system.</p>

<p>Lots of Korean built-in home automation system has integrated RF transmitter which opens the entrance door. So it must be designed with security in mind. Right?</p>
<p>However, lots of them just send RF signals without any anti-replay mechanism and can be replayed without much effort. Grab the SDR and replay the signal. Door unlocks.</p>
